# SoPra Projekt 2 - Nova Luna
In the **second phase of the Software Praktikum** at TU Dortmund, our team embarked on an ambitious project to create a **multiplayer game** with a wide array of complex features, including **AI agents, online play, and a comprehensive GUI interface**. This phase was particularly challenging because it involved collaborative work with a group of five people, each with specific roles and responsibilities. The project’s scale, combined with the collaborative aspect, made it a valuable learning experience in both technical and teamwork skills.

### Project Overview

The primary goal was to develop a **feature-rich, multiplayer game** that could be played online, complete with AI agents that can challenge human players. We aimed to create an engaging and functional experience that allowed players to choose whether they wanted to play against others or compete against the AI.

The game had several advanced features:
- **Multiplayer capabilities**, allowing users to play with each other in real-time.
- **AI agents** that could operate independently, providing a challenge for users who opted for single-player mode.
- **Online functionality** to enable players to connect and interact from different locations.
- A **fully functional GUI** that would make the gameplay experience seamless and interactive.

### My Roles and Contributions

In this project, I was responsible for two major roles:
1. **Developing the AI Agents**:
   - I implemented **two AI models** for our game, giving players the choice to select their preferred AI opponent:
     - **Monte Carlo Model**: This model uses probabilistic decision-making, exploring potential moves by simulating many random plays from a given position to predict the best outcome.
     - **Minimax Algorithm**: This approach evaluates possible moves based on minimizing the potential losses, considering optimal moves for both the AI and the opponent. It’s particularly effective for strategy-based games where anticipating the opponent’s moves is crucial.
   - These two models offered different play styles and difficulty levels, enriching the gaming experience by allowing users to switch between AI strategies depending on their preferences.
   - This role required extensive research on both Monte Carlo and Minimax algorithms, as well as tuning them to perform effectively within our game’s unique environment.

2. **Project Manager**:
   - As project manager, I was responsible for **ensuring smooth collaboration** across all team members, which included:
     - **Checking on each teammate’s progress** to ensure we were on track with our deadlines.
     - **Coordinating communication** within the team, facilitating regular check-ins and problem-solving discussions.
     - **Troubleshooting and problem-solving** by helping teammates address issues they encountered and guiding them toward solutions.
     - Making sure that we adhered to a project plan, adjusting priorities or timelines as needed to keep everything on course.
   - This role challenged me to develop strong communication and organizational skills, as I needed to stay informed about all aspects of the project and ensure that everyone had the support and resources needed to complete their tasks.

### Key Learnings and Skills Gained

This project provided invaluable insights and growth opportunities, especially in areas like teamwork, responsibility, and technical skill development:

1. **Technical Knowledge**:
   - Working on **AI development** deepened my understanding of **algorithmic strategies** like Monte Carlo and Minimax, and I gained practical experience in implementing these algorithms in a real-world setting.
   - The project also expanded my knowledge of **multiplayer online frameworks** and **GUI integration** for complex applications.

2. **Team Collaboration**:
   - The role of **project manager** taught me the importance of **effective communication** and **keeping a project organized**, particularly when working with a diverse team.
   - I learned to handle different personalities and work styles, which helped me develop patience and adaptability.
   - Balancing my responsibilities as both an AI developer and project manager taught me how to **multitask** effectively and prioritize my workload.

3. **Problem-Solving and Accountability**:
   - As project manager, I had to frequently tackle unexpected issues, from technical problems to team-related challenges. This experience sharpened my problem-solving abilities and my ability to think on my feet.
   - I developed a strong sense of **accountability**, as I was responsible for both my own work and the overall progress of the project.

### Conclusion

Overall, this project was an incredible learning experience. The combination of **advanced technical tasks** like AI development and the **management responsibilities** provided a well-rounded exposure to the demands of software development in a team setting. I not only expanded my technical skills but also gained insights into effective **team dynamics** and **project planning**, which will be invaluable for future collaborative projects.
